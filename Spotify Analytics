# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Then I imported the data from Excel into the the table.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.

#Who are the Top 10 artists on Spotify?
SELECT artist_name, sum(popularity) AS popular
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popular desc limit 10;

#Which artist has the longest song?
SELECT artist_name, max(duration_ms)
FROM Spotifydata;

#What is the average danceability of the Top 10 Songs?
SELECT avg(danceability)
FROM (
    select danceability from spotifydata
    ORDER BY popularity desc limit 10
    );
